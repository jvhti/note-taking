# Note Taking

This is a simple note taking web app made with [React](https://reactjs.org/). You can create and edit notes in [Markdown](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), this README was wrote using this web app.

I'm currently using a [Publish-subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) to get data around, but that could be changed to use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Roadmap

I'm still developing this project. Those are the nexts steps:

1. ~~SideNav Context Menu > Duplicate Note~~
2. ~~SideNav Context Menu > Share Note~~
3. ~~SideNav Context Menu > Print Note (if viable?)~~
4. ~~Implement a LocalStorage Database Driver~~
5. Implement an IndexedDB Database Driver
6. Write tests
7. Check/Improve accessibility
8. Use redux (remove PubSub)
9. Publish a production build and link here

And here are some small things that can be done:

- Improve modal buttons
- Improve animations
